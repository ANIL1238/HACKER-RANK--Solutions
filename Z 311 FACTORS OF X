'''
One day a teacher gave an assignment to the student to find the factors of a number. The student is not intrested to do the given task and he was searching for the shortcuts. So, please help him by writing a program

Input Format

First line contains an integer T denoting the no.of testcases.

The next T lines contains integers whose factors we have to determine

Constraints

1<=T<=10000

1<=N<=1000000

Output Format

Factors of number seperated by a space in the new line

Sample Input 0

2
4
5
Sample Output 0

1 2 4
1 5
