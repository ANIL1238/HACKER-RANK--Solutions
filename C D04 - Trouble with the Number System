Barua has developed his own Operating System known as "Barua OS" ( BOS ). One day while booting up his system he runs into a bug. You want to impress Barua so you jump in and offer to solve the bug yourself.
Barua doesn't like binary numbers very much and his operating system uses a new number system called BNS ( Barua Number System ).
The following are the properties of a number represented in BNS form :

The number can only be made up of 2 distinct digits, one or zero.
The number cannot start with zero.
The number can have any number of zeroes, but only one instance of the digit one.
For example 100, 1000, 10000 are Barua Numbers whereas 101, 502, 625 are not Barua Numbers. Unfortunately one decimal number has crept into a list of Barua Numbers and Barua OS cannot find its product. Can you?

Input Format:

First line contains an integer N, total number of elements in the list.

Next N lines contains a number a[i] <= 10^18.

NOTE :
Out of the N numbers, there will be at most 1 decimal number and the remaining numbers will be Barua Numbers.
There may be no decimal numbers at all.

Output Format:
Print one number, the product of all the numbers.

Input Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^6

1 <= A[i] <= 10^18
